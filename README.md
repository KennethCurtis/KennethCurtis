- 👋 Hi, I’m @KennethCurtis
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, specifically on performing pentetration testing and writing small scripts to automate testing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning eJPTv2, before moving on to eCPPT and then reworking through some previous lab sites.
- 💞️ I'm currently working on building a base kali linux server, so that I can begin moving from Kali VM over to using the server.
- My main goal with that is to begin building more python scripts, with a mix of curl and chromedriver to automate web-site testing.
- Afterwards, will begin working on setting up a docket network, to begin partitioning the way I would when doing pentesting.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my email @ kennethetcurtis@hotmail.com
